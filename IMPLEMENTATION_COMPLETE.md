# Alert Management System - Implementation Complete

## Summary

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Alert Management System for DitDashDot that integrates with the Service Mode theme. This implementation includes:

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Database Schema** (migrations/005_add_alerts.sql)
   - `alert_config` table: Stores per-service alert configurations
   - `alert_history` table: Tracks all alerts sent with timestamps and status
   - `service_status` table: Monitors service uptime/downtime in real-time
   - Added alert-related columns to `dashboard_config` table

2. **Backend API** (server/index.js)
   - Alert configuration CRUD endpoints
   - Webhook notification system using node-fetch
   - Enhanced ping endpoint with downtime tracking
   - Threshold-based alert triggering
   - Pause/unpause functionality
   - Alert history retrieval

3. **Frontend UI** (src/components/config/ConfigurationPage.js)
   - New "Alerts" tab in Configuration page
   - Global alert settings in General Settings tab
   - Per-service alert configuration UI
   - Pause/resume controls with visual indicators
   - Alert status display
   - Service Mode requirement enforcement

4. **Integration**
   - Service monitoring integrated with alert system
   - Webhooks triggered only in Service Mode
   - One alert per downtime period
   - Automatic recovery detection

5. **Documentation**
   - ALERTS.md: Comprehensive user guide
   - TESTING_GUIDE.md: Complete testing procedures
   - IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md: Technical implementation details
   - README.md: Updated with alert features
   - Migration script: run_005_migration.sh

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `server/index.js` - Enhanced with alert system
- `server/package.json` - Added node-fetch dependency
- `src/components/config/ConfigurationPage.js` - Added Alerts tab and UI
- `README.md` - Updated with alert features

### New Files:
- `migrations/005_add_alerts.sql` - Database schema changes
- `migrations/run_005_migration.sh` - Migration execution script
- `ALERTS.md` - User documentation
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing procedures
- `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` - Technical notes

## How It Works

1. **Service Monitoring**: The existing ping system (runs every 60s) has been enhanced to:
   - Track when services go down
   - Record downtime start time
   - Monitor downtime duration
   - Check alert configurations

2. **Alert Triggering**: When a service is down:
   - System checks if alert is enabled and not paused
   - Compares downtime against configured threshold
   - Sends ONE webhook notification when threshold is exceeded
   - Logs alert to history with status

3. **Webhook Payload**: Sends POST request with JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "service": {...},
     "status": "down",
     "downtime_minutes": 5,
     "timestamp": "...",
     "message": "Service ... has been down for 5 minutes"
   }
   ```

4. **Service Mode Integration**: 
   - Alerts only function when theme is set to "Service Mode"
   - UI clearly indicates this requirement
   - Alert settings disabled in other modes

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Apply Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec db psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -f /app/migrations/005_add_alerts.sql
   ```
   Or use the migration script:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec server bash /app/migrations/run_005_migration.sh
   ```

2. **Rebuild and Restart**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Configure Alerts**:
   - Navigate to `/config`
   - Set theme to "Service Mode"
   - Enable alerts in General Settings
   - Configure webhook URL
   - Set up per-service alerts in Alerts tab

4. **Test the System**:
   - Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md for comprehensive testing
   - Use webhook.site or similar for testing webhooks
   - Verify alerts trigger correctly

## Key Features

✅ **Custom Thresholds**: Set different downtime thresholds per service (default 5 minutes)
✅ **Webhook Notifications**: HTTP POST to configurable endpoints
✅ **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily suspend alerts without losing configuration
✅ **Service Mode Only**: Works exclusively with Service Mode theme
✅ **Alert History**: Complete audit trail of all notifications
✅ **Per-Service Config**: Global defaults with per-service overrides
✅ **Smart Alerting**: One alert per downtime period, no spam
✅ **Recovery Detection**: Automatic reset when service comes back up

## Testing Recommendations

See TESTING_GUIDE.md for detailed testing procedures. Quick start:

1. Set up webhook.site for testing
2. Enable Service Mode and alerts
3. Configure a test service with 1-minute threshold
4. Stop the service and wait for alert
5. Verify webhook received and history logged

## Limitations & Known Behaviors

- Alerts only work in Service Mode (by design)
- Services must have IP and Port configured for monitoring
- Ping interval is fixed at 60 seconds (in App.js)
- One alert per downtime period (prevents spam)
- Webhook timeout is 5 seconds
- Failed webhooks are logged but don't retry

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Email notification support
- SMS notification support  
- Multiple webhook URLs per service
- Alert templates customization
- Recovery notifications
- Alert escalation chains
- Alert acknowledgment system
- Configurable ping intervals
- Retry logic for failed webhooks

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check ALERTS.md for usage documentation
2. Review TESTING_GUIDE.md for testing procedures
3. Check server logs: `docker-compose logs server`
4. Query database tables for debugging
5. Review IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md for technical details
