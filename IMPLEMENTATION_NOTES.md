# Alert Management System - Implementation Notes

This implementation adds a complete alert management system for DitDashDot.

## Key Features Implemented

1. Database schema with three new tables (alert_config, alert_history, service_status)
2. Backend API endpoints for alert CRUD operations
3. Enhanced ping monitoring with downtime tracking
4. Webhook notification system
5. Frontend UI in Configuration page
6. Comprehensive documentation

## How It Works

The system monitors service health through the existing ping mechanism. When a service goes down:
- Downtime start time is recorded
- Each subsequent ping checks if threshold is exceeded
- If threshold is met and alerts are enabled, webhook is triggered
- Only one alert is sent per downtime period
- Alert is logged to history for tracking

## Integration Points

- Server: `/server/index.js` - Enhanced ping endpoint, new alert endpoints
- Frontend: `/src/components/config/ConfigurationPage.js` - New Alerts tab
- Database: `/migrations/005_add_alerts.sql` - Schema changes
- Documentation: `/ALERTS.md` - User guide

## Testing Recommendations

1. Set up a test webhook endpoint (webhook.site, requestbin.com)
2. Configure a service with IP/port in Service Mode
3. Enable alerts with 1-minute threshold for quick testing
4. Stop the service and wait for alert
5. Test pause/unpause functionality
6. Verify alert history is recorded

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email notification support
- SMS notification support
- Alert templates customization
- Recovery notifications
- Alert escalation
- Multiple webhook URLs per service
- Alert acknowledgment system
